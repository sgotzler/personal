I explore topics in digital scholarly editing/publishing, public humanities, cultural studies, and 20th century culture.

## Current Projects

**MARXdown** 

MARXdown is an online digital project developed for the [Contemporary Marxist Reading Group (CMRG)](https://cmrg-cmu.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University using the lightweight markup language Markdown. Designed to support group annotation of key texts for our CMRG, it provides a centralized and accessible online space for ongoing critical engagement between readers and materials related to the study of Marxist theory. This digital reading edition brings together the original English translation from 1887 Marx’s *Capital Vol. 1* with extant scholarly sources to create a multi-layered annotated edition of the text, providing critical reading guides and supplemental historical and sociological data in one easily accessible and user-friendly interface.

Collaborators: Avery J. Wiscomb, Daniel Evans. (ongoing)

- Check Out a Praxis Session we developed on ["Deploying Lightwight Digital Editions in the Community and Classroom"](https://sgotzler.github.io/praxis-session/) for the 17th Annual Conference of the Cultural Studies Association (CSA).

**Keywords in *Cultural Studies*** 

This collaborative digital project utilizes digital tools to explore the history of the journal *Cultural Studies*. The team will be analyzing a full-text corpus of the journal’s entire output since its founding in 1987. Using textual analysis methods for large-scale modeling we will explore new ways of viewing the history of the field through its flagship journal in the U.S.

Collaborators: Ted Striphas, Natalie Suzelis, Scott Weingart, Nathan Carpenter. (ongoing)

**The Frankenstein Variorum**

This project is preparing a new digital variorum edition of the novel Frankenstein. The variorum edition is a digital collation of five distinct versions of the novel produced between 1816 and 1831. With Professor Jon Klancher, Avery J. Wiscomb, and John Quirk, I have been working as a part of the team using the hypothes.is software to generate and manage a set of linked annotations across all 5 versions of the text. 

Collaborators: Jon Klancher, Elisa E. Beshero-Bondar, Matthew Lincoln, Rikk Mulligan, John Quirk, Emma Slayton, Raffaele Viglianti, Scott B. Weingart, Avery J. Wiscomb. (ongoing)

## Past Projects
 
**The Historical TV Guide / Mapping the Television Mega-Text** 

The Historical TV Guide uses digital tools to gather available textual data sources on television programming in the 1950s drawn from textual sources in online databases, archives and encyclopedias of television programming, much of which no longer exists in watchable form. Originally a distant reading project, entitled "Mapping the Television Mega-Text," we also used computational methods to analyze working-class content on 1950s television. 

Collaborators: Kathleen M. Newman, Daniel J. Evans, Scott B. Weingart, Emma Slayton. (2017-2019)

**The Frankenstein Complex** 

Commemorating the 200th anniversary of the publication of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, "The Frankenstein Complex" demonstrates the continuing relevance of Victor Frankenstein and his creature to contemporary audiences by relating rare university holdings such as the 1818 first edition of the text, and documents in the history of science from pioneering figures such as Luigi Galvani, to CMU's ongoing areas of scientific research including brain-computer interfaces, robotics, the visual arts and artificial intelligence. Examining these areas of contemporary research in light of the novel's much wider cultural legacy, the exhibit locates them within a 'complex' of ideas about the mind, the body, nature, ethical dilemmas, revolutions, and creators of all kinds. Ultimately, the exhibit encourages visitors to better understand how *Frankenstein* plays an important role in shaping our perceptions of technological innovations, and also how we continue to think about ourselves as humans.

Collaborators: Avery J. Wiscomb, John Quirk. (2018)
